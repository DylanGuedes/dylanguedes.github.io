I was evaluating it as the Spark resource manager on a experiment that I was going to perform, however, I didn't get good results and changed back to a different resource manager. I think the reasons were: I used Minikube, which is already not suitable for such a task, but also because Spark support for Kubernetes was not mature at that time. In any case, I was always interested in digging deep into Kubernetes but that was my only opportunity."
